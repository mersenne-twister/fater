# Fater
A way to define choose-your-own-adventure stories, with a webapp and tui
interface for viewing them.

# Webapp
view preview at:

https://mersenne-twister.github.io/fater/

(note that this currently includes only the default story, and is still
quite janky, and some things are unfinished)

Uses wasm for blazing-fast in-browser client-local parsing and viewing
of arbitrary stories.

# Tui

a terminal-user-interface --- like a gui, but in a terminal (like [neo]vi[m],
etc.)

TODO: implement it, add guide explaining it

# Creating them

TODO: guide explaining the syntax
